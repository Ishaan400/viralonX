00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.490
- Hey, everyone, Alec here with VEED.

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:02.323
And in this video,

00:00:02.323 --> 00:00:03.156
I'm going to be showing you

00:00:03.156 --> 00:00:05.530
how to add subtitles to a YouTube video.

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:07.450
So YouTube has recently updated

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:08.570
their upload process.

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.190
And now during the upload process,

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:11.530
you can add subtitles

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.060
while you're uploading your video.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.340
Now, in this video, I'm going to walk you

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.490
through that step by step.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:16.790
And we'll be adding our subtitles

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.280
to the YouTube video manually,

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.460
but after I've shown you this,

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.293
I'm gonna be showing you

00:00:20.293 --> 00:00:23.070
how to automatically
generate a subtitle SRT file

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.750
so you can upload your subtitles

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.810
with your YouTube video at the same time,

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.090
in just a few clicks.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.040
And with that being said,

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.930
let's get started.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:31.110
So once we're on YouTube,

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.500
to add subtitles to our video

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.380
while we upload it,

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.610
we're just going to upload a video

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:35.750
as we would normally.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:36.790
So here I'm just gonna click

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.270
on the create button right here.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.450
And then we're just gonna
select Upload video.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.620
Now we're taken to the
YouTube video upload page

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.080
and this is where I'm going to select

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.913
the YouTube video

00:00:44.913 --> 00:00:46.400
I want to upload to YouTube.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.030
So I click on Select Files

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.863
and then here

00:00:48.863 --> 00:00:50.200
I'm just going to select
my YouTube videos.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.180
As you see, I've got it here ready.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.080
I click Open

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.830
and now it's being uploaded to YouTube.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:56.663
So as you can see

00:00:56.663 --> 00:00:57.780
our video is now being uploaded

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:58.740
and here we can fill out

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.110
all the information for our video

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.070
as if we would normally.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.130
So when you upload a
video normally to YouTube,

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.030
you go ahead, you fill out the title,

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.340
you fill out the description.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.510
You might add a thumbnail,

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.180
you might add some tags at the bottom.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.500
Then once we click Next

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.410
to go to the next step

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:12.560
for the video elements,

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.450
here you'll notice that at the top,

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.580
we have this new section,

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.840
which is Add subtitles right next to it.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.010
As you can see, New.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.300
Now, there's always been the possibility

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.310
to add subtitles to a YouTube video,

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.610
but here YouTube implemented this section

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.660
directly within the upload process

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.810
because they know how
important subtitles are

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.400
and how important they're becoming

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.760
because video content
is dominating online.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.050
And it even says just below,

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.230
Reach a broader audience

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.200
by adding subtitles to your video.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.350
So even YouTube knows

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.270
that if you add subtitles to video,

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.810
you're going to get more reach

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:42.840
and more views.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.000
Now to add the subtitles,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.940
all we're going to do is click on Add

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.580
right next to add subtitles.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.240
And now you might recognize this.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.970
This is the YouTube subtitle editor.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.220
Now here, as you can see,

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.230
we've got three options.

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:55.170
We can upload a file

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.170
that we've already created.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.840
So this could be an SRT file.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.040
However, we don't have one,

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.160
but stick around I'm going to show you

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.160
how to generate one of these

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.650
automatically for your video.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:03.800
Then we can Auto-sync.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.670
And this is basically,

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.730
if you have a full transcript

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.660
of your video script,

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.240
you can basically just copy and paste it

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.900
and then YouTube will auto sync it up

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.030
to match the words when you say them.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.940
And then obviously
we've got Type manually.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.320
And this is where you can
add subtitles in manually

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.890
by clicking in the time

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.120
and then typing out what I say.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.953
So for an example,

00:02:22.953 --> 00:02:24.520
if I just want to add a subtitle here,

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.840
I click on Type manually.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:26.910
And then at the beginning,

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.387
let's listen to what I say.

00:02:28.387 --> 00:02:30.490
"So I've got this video."

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:31.907
So my very first subtitle would be,

00:02:31.907 --> 00:02:32.960
"So I've got this video."

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.960
So I've got this video.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.820
Perfect. Now, as you can see

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.260
for the timestamps for this subtitle,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.680
we go from zero seconds to 1.29 seconds.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.620
So if I play it back

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.520
and we pay attention here,

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.887
we can actually see the
subtitle in the box.

00:02:49.887 --> 00:02:50.797
"So I've got this video

00:02:50.797 --> 00:02:53.140
and I want to add subtitles to it."

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.973
So as you can see,

00:02:53.973 --> 00:02:55.590
our subtitle is dragging a little bit,

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.423
because it disappears

00:02:56.423 --> 00:02:57.530
after we've finished saying it.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:58.620
So here we can either go

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.040
and adjust timestamp right here,

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.020
or we can go and just click and drag it

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.830
directly within the timeline.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.320
And then I can click on Add caption

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.590
to add the next one.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.207
So let's see what I say next.

00:03:09.207 --> 00:03:11.007
"And I want to add subtitles to it."

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:13.727
Okay. Here I say,

00:03:13.727 --> 00:03:18.727
"And I want to add subtitles to it."

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.290
So now I've got my first two subtitles.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.410
And that's how you add subtitles

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.350
to your YouTube video.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.183
You can understand

00:03:24.183 --> 00:03:25.560
that it can be very time consuming.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.640
Once you've finished adding
all of your subtitles,

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.473
all you want to do

00:03:28.473 --> 00:03:29.910
is make sure you click Done

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.420
in the top right

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.570
and then YouTube will save your subtitles.

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:34.760
However, as you notice

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.790
this takes a lot of time,

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.310
so here's how to automatically generate

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.240
a subtitle file for your video.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.400
So we're going to head over

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.360
to a website called veed.io.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.470
You can either head over to Google

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.370
and google VEED, which is V-E-E-D.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.800
If not, as usual link is gonna be

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.450
in the description down below.

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.283
Once you're on VEED,

00:03:49.283 --> 00:03:50.230
if you don't already have an account,

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.750
you can create an account for free.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.220
And if you do, we're just gonna click

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.980
on the Create New Project button.

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.210
Here we're taken to the upload screen

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.010
and we're just gonna
click on Upload a File.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.140
Select our YouTube video, click Open.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.973
And as you can see,

00:04:01.973 --> 00:04:03.130
our YouTube video is now imported

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.030
into VEED's Video Editor.

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.907
So now if we take a look and press play.

00:04:06.907 --> 00:04:08.230
"So I've got this video."

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.200
We have the exact same video.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.910
And basically to automatically
generate subtitles

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.370
for my YouTube video,

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.540
all I have to do is
click on the Subtitle tab

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.680
in the left toolbar.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.340
And here again, we've got three options

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.060
and this time one of the options

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.520
is Auto-Transcribe.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.410
And as you can see here,

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.190
it says automatically add subtitles

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.210
to your video.

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.580
So if I click on this,

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.040
I then select the language

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.340
that I want to automatically transcribe

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.130
and turn into subtitles.

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.160
Here as you can see, I've got English.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.860
And I'm just gonna stay with English.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.490
Then I click on Start.

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:39.323
And as you can see,

00:04:39.323 --> 00:04:41.060
this process may take a few seconds

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.893
to a few minutes,

00:04:41.893 --> 00:04:43.540
depending on the length of your video

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.470
to automatically transcribe
your videos audio into text

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.913
and turn that text into subtitles.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:50.753
So as you can see

00:04:50.753 --> 00:04:52.140
VEED has just finished generating

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.720
the subtitles for our video.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.370
And now the first thing you notice is

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:56.337
that our sentence.

00:04:56.337 --> 00:04:57.380
"So I've got this video

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.640
and I want to add subtitles to it."

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:00.740
This is the exact video

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:01.990
that we typed out manually

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.390
within YouTube's studio.

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.307
So now if I press play and we take a look.

00:05:06.307 --> 00:05:07.530
"So I've got this video

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.310
and I want to add subtitles to it.

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.420
Hey, everyone, my name is Alec.

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:11.620
And in this video, I'm
gonna be showing you

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.810
how to add subtitles to any video online.

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.570
And to get started."

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:16.420
So, as you can see,

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.540
we've automatically
generated the subtitles

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.230
for our video.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:21.700
Now, if you want to change

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.600
and adjust a few things, for example,

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.970
in this automatically
generated transcript,

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:27.440
as you can see here, it says, Alex,

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.273
instead of Alec,

00:05:28.273 --> 00:05:29.790
so I'm just gonna quickly correct that,

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.450
but this is a very common mistake,

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:32.430
even on the iPhone,

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.860
my name is always auto corrected to Alex,

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:35.730
but I always recommend

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:36.630
just quickly going through

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:37.900
and checking your subtitles.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.790
But just from the first sentence,

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:41.950
we can see that it's
already pretty accurate.

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:43.850
And then to download it as an SRT file

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:45.300
so we can upload it to YouTube,

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.133
all we're going to do

00:05:46.133 --> 00:05:48.060
is click on the Options tab right here.

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.610
And then here we have the
Download Subtitles section.

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:51.740
And we have multiple formats

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.300
which we can download our subtitles as.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.470
And we're just going to select SRT Format

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.790
which is the subtitle format,

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.050
click on Download.

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:01.020
And as you can see here,

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.800
we now have our SRT file.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.400
So I'm going to head over back to YouTube

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.890
and this time I'm just going to delete

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:08.920
the subtitles that I manually typed in.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.920
And if we click on Add again,

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.620
here we're going to
click on Upload a file.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.030
I'm going to choose With timing

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.400
because our subtitle file has timing.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.620
I click Continue.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.070
And then I'm just going to select

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:21.010
the SRT file

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:23.780
that we've just automatically
generated using VEED.

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.070
Click Open and now as you can see,

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:27.320
all of the subtitles

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.200
with the corrections that I made

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.300
have been imported into YouTube.

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.920
Now I can just click Done.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.730
And that is how to upload subtitles

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.020
to a YouTube video

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.840
after YouTube's new upload process update.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:40.673
If you have any questions

00:06:40.673 --> 00:06:42.440
about adding subtitles to a YouTube video,

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:43.273
I would love to hear them

00:06:43.273 --> 00:06:44.640
in the comment section down below.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:45.473
